* mass import (done)
* holepunching for services (done, deactivated)
* improve tests
* better code quality

* tests for wrap, traversal, massimport
* ipv4, ipv6 compatibility checks

* remove stupid pw check it allows server to overtake control over client connections (done)
* fix exposing crypted pw of client to server (done)
* remote access to client only with trusteddb (done)
* maybe re-add some sort of protection for local sockets (done)
* WARNING::server.py:152::check_brokencerts::[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer

# features:
* cert hash based protection
* improved pw stuff
* unix sockets
* advanced url support (by using getaddrinfo, causes a small slowdown on clientside)

## future
* default pwhandler for different environments (e.g. kivy, gtk, windows, tk)
* check if traversal request succeeded
