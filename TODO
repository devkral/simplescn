The real solution:
remove gui crap including plugins, config, do_GET
should be a different project




The solution for pluginmanager:
pluginmanager->plugin communication via stdin stdout
plugin->simplescn via socket

init:
the port+cert is transferred via stdin

getline loop in plugin for receiving commands

use per plugin cert/different server
first solution: should do_GET be removed and only connections with cert be allowed?
second solution: how to check which plugin, a server per plugin?


## 0.2
* generalized module for connecting
* wrap, also with extended syntax for certchecking (requires generalized module for connecting)
* rewrite pluginmanager
* better isolation of plugins
* pwhandling for plugins
* ui_node_session
* ui_main_session
* predefined config shortcuts (e.g. json for saving in json format)

## Future
* Webgui
* kivy gui (limitation to one window, so ignore)
* announce client/server
* filesockets
* holepunching for services
* localisation
* mass import
