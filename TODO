## 0.3
* mass import (done)
* holepunching for services (done)
* improve tests
* better code quality

* tests for wrap, traversal, massimport
* ipv4, ipv6 compatibility checks
* resolve ipv4 addresses in ipv6 format (done)
* remove stupid pw check it allows server to overtake control over client (half done)
* fix exposing crypted pw of client to server
* idea for next gen pw check: mix pw with client_certhash and timestamp, server offers timestamp and mixed pw certhash
* remote access to client only with trusteddb (done)
* add uncrypted unix socket server for client
* maybe re-add some sort of protection for local sockets

##
* improve pw stuff (maybe remove it for non server components (replaced by certhashes))


## future
* default pwhandler for different environments (e.g. kivy, gtk, windows, tk)
* check if traversal request succeeded
