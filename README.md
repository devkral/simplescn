Simple replacement for dyndns.
Just register your clients with their own new generated keys
nodes are not permanent, a restart deletes the entries on the server

Features:
-passwordprotection
-entirely controllable by webbrowser

This is a rewrite of scn.
It got too complex because of unnecessary features (channels and nodes), too much lowlevel work (an own protocol), focus on gui and a client and serverside account management.

TODO:
-web-GUI
--password requests
------
-GUI

FUTURE:
-priority
-use nodetypes to differ type (server/client)
